Topic:
Particle Physics

Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of using a combination
of Computer Graphics, Classical Mechanics, and Artistic Design to develop a
simple system which can both simulate, animate and render multiple 
particles using classical particle physics equations as well as some addition
mathematics to simulate certain behaviors. Some features we'd like to create
include magnetism, smoke and fire.

Approach:
Using an iterative approach we'd like to do the following:
1. Research a behavior we'd like to simulate
2. Develop a simulation of this behavior/add to existing simulation
3. Use OpenGL to render the particles that are taking part in this simulation
4. Tune up code for accuracy
5. Go to step 1 for new behavior

Challenges:
1. Ensuring the code is portable
2. Dividing up work between group members
3. Accurately modelling physics
4. Ensuring the CPU is not over-strained by the simulation
5. Understanding some of the more complex visual components of the simulation

Achievements:
1. Created a working engine which demonstrates basic particle physics properties
2. A couple of basic examples of systems which mimic real world phenomena:
    smoke and blood splatter(or lava, depending on how you see it)
3. System which takes advantage of polymorphism for easy creation of effects

Limitations:
1. Time limited; only able to create a couple of effects
2. Limited knowledge of physics

Future Work:
1. Create more effects that inherit from "particlesystem" class
2. Ability to pass function in to spawnParticle() to have dynamic particle origins
3. More forces and better equations for more realistic physics
